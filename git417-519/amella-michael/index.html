						<h3>Sansevieria</h3>
						<p>$20.00</p>
						<p>If you're new to the indoor plant game or are simply looking for an easy-care houseplant, the Sansevieria is the plant for you. This hardy plant is renowned for its adaptability and its classic sword-like leaves. While it does best in bright indirect sunlight, it can truly withstand all light levels from full sun to low light. The Sansevieria is also drought tolerant, making it able to take a little neglect. Keep its sturdy leaves dust-free by wiping them regularly.</p>

						<h3>Silver Satin Pothos</h3>
						<p>$35.00</p>
						<p>The Silver Satin Pothos leaves are otherworldly with a green base and patches of metallic silver that shimmer when reflecting light. With striking foliage, this plant is part of the Scindapsus genus and not a true pothos, though it looks the part. This vining plant grows densely and is quite easy to care for, making it a great choice for mantles, shelves, and hanging planters.</p>

						<h3>Money Tree</h3>
						<p>$50.00</p>
						<p>The Money Tree is the perfect low-care indoor plant to bring a tropical feel with a touch of good fortune. With its intricately braided trunk and bright green, palm-like leaves, it looks both like a tree and a palm. The Money Tree gets its name in part from the natural Feng Shui this plant gives. It's believed this plant will bring positive energy and good luck to the owner. The gorgeous Money Tree makes for a meaningful gift or your own good luck charm.</p>
