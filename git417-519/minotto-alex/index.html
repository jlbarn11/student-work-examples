          <h3>Fahrenheit 451</h3>
          <p>Ray Bradbury</p>
          <p>Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.</p>

          <h3>Lord of the Flies</h3>
          <p>William Golding</p>
          <p>At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate. But as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far removed from reality as the hope of being rescued.</p>

          <h3>In Cold Blood</h3>
          <p>Truman Capote</p>
          <p>In Cold Blood is a non-fiction novel that details the event on November 15, 1959. In the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy.</p>

          <h3>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</h3>
          <p>Frederick Douglass</p>
          <p>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is an 1845 memoir and treatise on abolition written by famous orator, brilliant writer, and former slave Frederick Douglass during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts. In this amazing first-hand narrative, he vividly recounts his early years, which were filled with physical abuse, deprivation, and tragedy; his dramatic escapes to the North, recapture, and eventual freedom; his work for the Anti-Slavery Society and influential role in speaking for other African-Americans; his abolitionist campaigns, and crusade for full civil rights for former slaves.</p>
