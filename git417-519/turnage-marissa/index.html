                        <h3>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</h3>
                        <p>
                            Become Eivor, a mighty Viking raider and lead your clan from the harsh shores of Norway to a new home amid the lush farmlands of ninth-century England. Explore a beautiful, mysterious open world where you'll face brutal enemies, raid fortresses, build your clan's new settlement, and forge alliances to win glory and earn a place in Valhalla. England in the age of the Vikings is a fractured nation of petty lords and warring kingdoms. Beneath the chaos lies a rich and untamed land waiting for a new conqueror. Will it be you?<br>
                            Lead your people in massive assaults against Saxon armies and fortresses, and expand your influence far beyond your settlementâ€™s borders. Command a crew of raiders and launch lightning-fast surprise attacks from your longship to claim your enemiesâ€™ riches for your clan.<br>
                            Unleash the ruthless fighting style of a Viking warrior and dual-wield axes, swords, or even shields against fierce, relentless foes. Choose your tactics and dismember opponents in close-quarters combat, riddle them with arrows, or assassinate them with your hidden blade.<br>

                            America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him. <br>
                            Red Dead Redemption 2 also includes the shared living world of Red Dead Online â€“ forge your own path as you battle lawmen, outlaw gangs and ferocious wild animals to build a life on the American frontier. Build a camp, ride solo or form a posse and explore everything from the snowy mountains in the North to the swamps of the South, from remote outposts to busy farms and bustling towns. Chase down bounties, hunt, fish and trade, search for exotic treasures, run your own underground Moonshine distillery, or become a Naturalist to learn the secrets of the animal kingdom and much more in a world of astounding depth and detail.<br>

                        <h3>Tomb Raider</h3>
                        <p>Tomb Raider explores the intense and gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor. Armed only with raw instincts and the ability to push beyond the limits of human endurance, Lara must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island to escape its relentless hold. Explore a mysterious island filled with environmental puzzles, visceral combat, and tombs to discover. Salvage resources, gain experience, and upgrade Laraâ€™s weapons and tools to survive the islandâ€™s hostile inhabitants.<br>
                        As the game progresses, base camps become unlocked, giving Lara a place to craft new upgrades out of salvage items. Base camps also offer a place for Lara to learn new skills in the "skill system" to unlock new parts of the island to explore. Fast travel is available between base camps.<br>
                        Puzzles are much harder than in previous games; the player will need the elements of water, wind, and fire as well as friction to solve puzzles.<br>
